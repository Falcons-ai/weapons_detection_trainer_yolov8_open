## Weapon Detection Yolov8 Trainer:
<br />
Welcome to the Yolo v8 Object Detection for Weapon Detection repository! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that guides you through the process of training an end-to-end weapon detection model using Yolo v8 Object Detection. This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to train a powerful image classifier for weapons detection at a basic level.

We at Falcons.ai have invested considerable effort in putting together this Jupyter Notebook with the aim of making it easy for you to use and follow. We hope that this resource will be helpful in your efforts to create a weapon detection model.


## Dataset:
https://app.roboflow.com/mike-ovbzu/weapons_detection-tsdac/8

## Training
- ** Please check the batch size as you may need to reduce it substantially depending on your GPU.
- The Jupyter Notebook will guide you through the training process, including setting up the configuration, data augmentation, and running the training procedure. Be patient, as training a Yolo v8 model can take a considerable amount of time, depending on your dataset and hardware.

## Evaluation and Inference
After training, you can evaluate the model's performance and use it for inference on new images.
